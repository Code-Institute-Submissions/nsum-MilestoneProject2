#### Code Institute - Milestone Project 2 

## Image Scramble Game

![Am I Responsive](/assets/images/readmeImages/responsive.png)

## Introduction

Welcome, this is Image Tile Scramble Game made for second Milestone Project with Code Institute, made using HTML, CSS & JS.
I found it very difficult to develop my own game from scratch, as for me, CI modules covering JS were poorly made and I wasn't able to learn a lot. 
Game idea and code comes from Techno Geek (linked below), I changed the code and structure to better fit my idea, and added interactability to page.

## Features 

+ Game is won by arranging scrambled tiles to match original image
+ 5 difficulty levels that range from "easy" to "insane"
+ "Move Count" & "Elapsed Time" count the steps and time taken to solve the puzzle
+ "Rules" button shows the game rules and basic game help
+ "Hint" button shows or hides original image to give visual hint or aid in solving the puzzle
+ "Like What You See?" button shows information about the location of the image currently being played

+   ### Wireframes 
    + Attached wireframes differ from finished site as I went slightly in another direction during development, 
        and decided not to use APIs or make multi page site.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
